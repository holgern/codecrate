# codecrate

Convert a Python repository into a Markdown "context pack" for LLMs:

- **Function Library**: bodies appear once, each referenced by a stable short ID.
- **Files View**: original files preserved, with function bodies replaced by ID markers.

## Install

```bash
python -m pip install -e .
```
